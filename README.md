How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, 
which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two.
What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

    The programs that were written were modularized, which helps with maintainability, with easily understood code with commented notes for usage.
    The abstraction of the CRUDModule program is helpful for modifying the interactions with the database, without affecting the code base.
    This type of programming is helpful in scalability and efficiency, building on what we've learned so far about best coding practices.
    This CRUD module could be helpful in managing future databases or as a foundation for building APIs.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. 
How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? 
What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

    Approaching problems requires analysis of the problem, hypothesizing a solution, and then methodically building a test for a solution to the problem.
    The database offered exercising this approach by designing, building, and testing the database and dashboard requested.
    This project focused much more on the building aspect of client-side interfaces and server-side databases than other courses.
    This course essentially had us design our first API as well through the use of a Python module that carried out interactions between the two.
    Explore NoSQL database frameworks and implement automated testing to ensure capable code without breaking the system or functionalities.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

    Computer scientists are building a better tomorrow by automating processes and allowing technologies to become simpler to for the common person.
    Thanks to the work of computer scientists the everyday person can single-handedly undergo projects that used to require entire professional team.
    Activities such as graphic design, sound engineers, building a website, and more have all become much easier thanks to the advances of Computer Scientists.
    The type of work, such as the work done on this project, helps companies to streamline their data and activities to allow themselves to focus on what they are good at.
    I believe technology is not meant to replace humans or what they do, only to boost their efficiency and confidence in what they are already doing.
